## Welcome to the Six Degrees of Tweetification documentation!

**For project setup, please see [the setup guide](./articles/Project-Setup.html).**

For an overview of the project, please see [here](./articles/Home.html).

For a simplified description of the server API, see [here](./articles/Six-Degrees-API.html).
Likewise, the security-related server information can be found [here](./articles/Security.html).

For more complete HTML documentation on the back-end, see [here](./api/SixDegrees.html).
Please note that the generated docs for the back-end only contain publicly-visible classes and methods. Most non-public code should be sufficiently documented within the source code itself; the rest is trivial or consists of self-explanatory helper functions.
